This is an implementation of the Soundex Search algorithm as an OpenMRS module.

It does not contain any UI elements. Instead it internally wraps calls to the service method
PatientService.getPatient(String query). This is done with help of Spring AOP.
In case an activator code (":soundex" or ":s") is prepended to the patient search query string a
soundex search is executed based updon soundex name codes stored in the database table person_name_codes.
